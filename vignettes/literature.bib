  abstract =	 {We describe a new technique for the analysis of
                  dyadic data, where two sets of objects (row and
                  column objects) are characterized by a matrix of
                  numerical values that describe their mutual
                  relationships.  The new technique, called potential
                  support vector machine (P-SVM), is a large-margin
                  method for the construction of classifiers and
                  regression functions for the column
                  objects. Contrary to standard support vector machine
                  approaches, the P-SVM minimizes a scale-invariant
                  capacity measure and requires a new set of
                  constraints. As a result, the P-SVM method leads to
                  a usually sparse expansion of the classification and
                  regression functions in terms of the row rather than
                  the column objects and can handle data and kernel
                  matrices that are neither positive definite nor
                  square. We then describe two complementary
                  regularization schemes. The first scheme improves
                  generalization performance for classification and
                  regression tasks; the second scheme leads to the
                  selection of a small, informative set of row support
                  objects and can be applied to feature
                  selection. Benchmarks for classification,
                  regression, and feature selection tasks are
                  performed with toy data as well as with several
                  real-world data sets. The results show that the new
                  method is at least competitive with but often
                  performs better than the benchmarked standard
                  methods for standard vectorial as well as true
                  dyadic data sets. In addition, a theoretical
                  justification is provided for the new approach.},

                  drugs to elicit genetic damage in mammalian cells in
                  vitro. Due to the limitations of experimental
                  genotoxicity testing in early drug discovery phases,
                  a model to predict the chromosome aberration test
                  yielding high accuracy and providing guidance for
                  structure optimization is urgently needed. In this
                  paper, we describe a machine learning approach for
                  predicting the outcome of this assay based on the
                  structure of the investigated compound.  The novelty
                  of the proposed method consists in combining a
                  maximum common subgraph kernel for measuring the
                  similarity of two chemical graphs with the potential

                  classifiers, the proposed approach does not provide

                  pharmaceutical industry as well as to other graph

                  to probe biological systems and to discover new
                  drugs and other useful compounds. As increasing
                  numbers of large datasets of small molecules become
                  available, it is necessary to develop computational
                  methods that can deal with molecules of variable
                  size and structure and predict their physical,
                  chemical and biological properties. RESULTS: Here we
                  develop several new classes of kernels for small
                  molecules using their 1D, 2D and 3D representations.
                  In 1D, we consider string kernels based on SMILES
                  strings. In 2D, we introduce several similarity
                  kernels based on conventional or generalized
                  fingerprints. Generalized fingerprints are derived
                  by counting in different ways subpaths contained in
                  the graph of bonds, using depth-first searches. In
                  3D, we consider similarity measures between
                  histograms of pairwise distances between atom
                  classes. These kernels can be computed efficiently
                  and are applied to problems of classification and
                  prediction of mutagenicity, toxicity and anti-cancer
                  activity on three publicly available datasets. The
                  results derived using cross-validation methods are
                  state-of-the-art. Tradeoffs between various kernels
                  are briefly discussed. AVAILABILITY: Datasets
